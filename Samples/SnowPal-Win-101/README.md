# Win 101: Snowpal

This sample is intended as beginner sample that showcase a word guessing game app that uses WinUI, Windows App SDK and Windows Community Toolkit. This sample is the final app that is built in the [WinUi 101](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/winui-101/) lab.

In this SnowPal game, the app selects a word for the user to guess, displaying it as a series of blank spaces where each space represents a letter. The player guesses letters one at a time; for every incorrect guess, part of the SnowPal character melts away. If the player guesses all letters before exhausting their turns, they win; otherwise, they lose.
